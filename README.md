# LinkedList
This is the Python implementation of Linked lists. I have considered a single-linked list for now.

## Features
Node and List Class Separation â€“ Clear distinction between Node (data holder) and SinglyLinkedList (controller).

## Essential Operations:

Append (insert at end)

Insert at the beginning

Insert at a given position

Delete from the beginning

Delete from the end

Delete at any position

Input validation and robust error handling for common edge cases.

Next Steps
Add print and traversal functionality.

Implement search and update operations.

Extend to Doubly and Circular Linked Lists.

Add test cases and LeetCode-style problems for further mastery.

 ## Contributions
Pull requests, suggestions, and new problems or methods are welcome! Open issues for bug reports or discussion.
